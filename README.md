## How it works

- Anyone can organize the Lottery program and advertize so people can participate in the Lottery.
- Lottery organizer gets commission for organizing lottery from the winner's lottery amount.
- Lottery organizer will decide whats the entry_fees and commission_rate at the time Lottery initialization.
- After Lottery init participants can participate by providing entry_fees (program will deduce entry fees from participants account).
- Finally Lottery organizer calls lottery program with pickWinner instruction then the Lottery program will choose one winner from n number of participants and transfer all pooled amount (minus commission) to winner.
